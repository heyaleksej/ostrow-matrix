This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using [Material Ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/) library


# Intro

Effective frequency , a cornerstone of media planning, says how many times consumers should be exposed to advertising in
order for advertising to be the most effective. Basic effective frequency level is believed to be ‘ three-plus
’exposures and this figure is adopted by most media planners. Beside the basic level, marketing, media and creative copy
factors influence the final determination of effective frequency level. Such factors, defined by Ostrow in 1982, were
not revised for more than 29 years and still are used in media planning textbooks.

# Model description

The model consists of a table of evaluation of 20 factors that can influence the effectiveness of an advertising
message. 20 factors are grouped into 3 groups:
- market factors, 
- advertising message quality factors (including creative),
- media factors.

The assessment is carried out for each factor on a 4-point scale from (-2) to (+2). The evaluation is carried out as follows: the initial base
frequency for an advertising campaign according to the Ostrow model = 3; after filling in the table, all points scored
as a result of the assessment are summed up and added to the initial base frequency; the resulting frequency is the
minimum threshold for the effectiveness of the advertising message.
